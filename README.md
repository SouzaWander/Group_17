# Countries Energy Mix Analysis


In this study, it was intended to analyze the energy consumption of different countries, as well as the emissions associated with this consumption.
In addition, we also used each country's GDP to help with our analysis.
In our code, we created a class called 'EnergyAnalysis' with 7 methods inside. After each method, we describe the different fiddings we made.

In these methods, we intended to make several analyzes such as:
- An analysis of the correlation of the GDP with the energy consumption of the countries.
- An analysis of the absolute and relative values of the different types of emissions, after selecting three different countries (Germany, Russia and China).
- An analysis of the evolution of GDP and Total Energy Consumption of the 3 selected countries from 1970 to 2015.
- An analysis of the Correlation between Emissions and Energy Consumption of the 3 countries.
- A small forecast of the future total consumption and total emissions of these 3 countries.

**Note**: The three selected countries were just examples that we found interesting. Indeed, when using the available methods, the user can choose other countries that he finds relevant to extract his own insights.
